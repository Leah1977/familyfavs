## Project Testing

### Links

Tested all links on all pages. All links work as intended. This allows the user to move from one page to another with ease.


**Expected**

When you click on the options drop-down menu item, it is expected to drop down with a list of items that you can click on.
* The first link returns you to the game.
* The second link leads to a modal that instructs you on how to play the game.
* The third option is to bring you to a form to sign up for further information.


**Testing**

I clicked on the drop-down menu.
I clicked on each option.

**Result**

When you click on  Home, you are returned to the home page.
When you click on How to Play, a modal pops up with instructions on How To Play.
When you click on Sign up, you are redirected to a sign-up page.

I checked the submit button by clicking on it.
Click on the Home Button to return to the game.

**Expected**

When you enter your details, they are displayed as entered.
When you click on the submit button, the form is submitted - this site is static.
When you click on the Home button, you are returned to the game.

**Testing**

Tested the form by filling out details for all sections.

User is able to navigate from page to page by clicking on links and buttons.

2. I expect to be able to search for recipes.

User can search for items on the home page by entering the item in the search bar.

3. I would expect the app to be visually appealing.

I have used light colours, mainly green and yellow to give a fresh and appealing look to the website.
